# Football fixture and ticket planner

A personal, mobile-first static site on GitHub Pages that helps Alexandru
(Leonberg, near Stuttgart) plan which football matches to attend and not
miss ticket windows. Data is refreshed by GitHub Actions cron jobs that
commit JSON back to this repo. There is no server and no build step.

Alexandru does not write code. Explanations should say what to do and
what he should see, not how the code works.

---

## The rules that matter most

**1. Never generate a ticket rule, sale date, application window or
deadline.** No API has them. They are hand-written by Alexandru because a
plausible-sounding wrong deadline is worse than a blank field. If you
find yourself about to write a date because it "usually" falls around
then, stop.

**2. A missing field stays blank and gets reported.** Never fill a gap
with a guess, an inference or a rounded-off "typical" value. Every tool
here prints what it could not resolve, with a reason. That reporting is a
feature, not noise — keep it when you change things.

**3. Hand-written data beats fetched data, always.** `clubs-manual.csv`
overrides Wikidata. `fixtures-manual.csv` is never touched by the cron.
`football-rules.json` is never written by any script. If a fetched source
and a hand-written one disagree, the hand-written one wins and the code
does not get a vote.

**4. Fetched data never becomes a calendar event.** The `.ics` feeds are
hand-curated. `data/fixtures/` feeds the map and the app only. Bundesliga
alone is 306 matches; putting fetched fixtures in a subscribed calendar
would bury the handful of things that actually need acting on.

**5. Ask before building when something is ambiguous. Push back when he
is wrong.** He has asked for this explicitly and has been right often
enough that it matters — several of the better decisions in this project
came from him correcting a proposal.

## dateSource

Replaces an older `confirmed` boolean. Three values, used in
`football-rules.json` and `fixtures-manual.csv`:

| value | meaning | behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `confirmed` | from a published source | normal calendar event |
| `inferred` | reasoned from a known pattern; right season, possibly wrong by days or weeks | emits with a `[?]` prefix and an alarm saying "check whether this has been announced" |
| `disputed` | may be the wrong year or the wrong event entirely | never emits; listed in `skipped.md` only |

The distinction is imprecision versus possible nonsense. An entry whose
date might be eleven years old is `disputed` and stays out of the
calendar entirely — a `[?]` prefix is not enough, because anything inside
a subscribed calendar reads as a schedule regardless of its description.

## Files

### Hand-written — never write to these from a script

- `data/football-rules.json` — ticket rules, bucket list, clubs, settings.
  The irreplaceable file. Structure is decided; do not redesign it.
- `data/fixtures-manual.csv` — fixtures Alexandru enters himself, mostly
  Romanian. Header-driven, so column order does not matter and unused
  optional columns may be omitted. Required: `date`, `home`, `away`,
  `feed`, `dateSource`.
- `data/clubs-manual.csv` — corrections and additions to the club layer.
  A row with a `clubQid` overrides only the cells that are filled in; a
  row without one adds a club; `skip` in the tier column removes one,
  which is how a duplicate Wikidata item is dropped. A `skip` row needs
  a `clubQid`, because there has to be something already there to
  remove, and every other cell on it is ignored. Same column set as
  `capacity-review.csv`.
- `data/league-tiers.csv` — maps a league's Wikidata Q-id to a tier.
  Tier comes from this file and never from a league name: Wikidata's
  league items are fragmented and undated, so names cannot be trusted.
  `skip` in the tier column excludes a league.

### Generated — safe to overwrite

- `calendars/*.ics`, `calendars/skipped.md`, `calendars/.stamps.json`
- `data/fixtures/*.json` — football-data.org, one file per competition
- `data/clubs/*.json` — Wikidata plus manual corrections
- `data/clubs/unmapped-leagues.csv` — seed list for `league-tiers.csv`
- `data/clubs/capacity-review.csv` — disagreements for Alexandru to judge
- `data/clubs/coordinate-review.csv` — proposed coordinates for clubs
  Wikidata cannot place, for Alexandru to judge

### Code

- `index.html` — the whole app. Single file, no framework, Leaflet from
  CDN, three tabs: map, bucket list, ticket info.
- `tools/build_calendars.py` — `.ics` generation
- `tools/fetch_fixtures.py` — football-data.org
- `tools/fetch_clubs.py` — Wikidata club layer
- `tools/crosscheck_capacity.py` — OpenStreetMap capacity comparison
- `tools/propose_coordinates.py` — OpenStreetMap coordinates for the
  clubs Wikidata cannot place. Matches on names, proposes only, and
  flags anything ambiguous rather than settling it with a rule.

## Conventions the tools rely on

**Determinism.** `build_calendars.py` produces byte-identical output when
nothing has changed, using `.stamps.json` to freeze `DTSTAMP` and bump
`SEQUENCE` only on real changes. Without this the daily cron commits a
diff every morning and every calendar client re-syncs every event
forever. Do not break this.

**Read-back.** Anything parsed from a hand-written file is printed back
in the run summary exactly as understood, with line numbers for rejected
rows. Alexandru cannot read the code, so this is how he verifies that
what went in is what he meant.

**Failure is visible.** Use `set -o pipefail` in workflow steps that pipe
to `tee`, or a crashing script shows a green tick. This has already
caused one silent failure.

**Past dates drop out of calendars but stay in the JSON.** The file is
the history and the anchor for next year's estimate; the calendar is only
what lies ahead.

**Six feeds plus admin**: `bayern`, `germany-nt`, `local`, `italy`,
`romania`, `uefa-finals`, `admin`. `local` means within day-trip range of
Leonberg, not a fixed list of clubs. `bayern` is a loyalty feed and stays
separate even though Munich is also day-trip range. Hand-entered fixtures
go to `fixtures-<feed>.ics`, never into the ticket-window feeds.

**Distance** is straight-line times `settings.estimateMultiplier` (1.25).
No routing API. It is a road-distance estimate and is deliberately not
converted into a travel time, because that would need an invented average
speed.

## Secrets

`FOOTBALL_DATA_TOKEN` is in Actions secrets. It must never appear in
client code, in `data/`, or anywhere under `calendars/`. No other key is
needed: Wikidata, Overpass and OpenLigaDB are all free and keyless.

---

## Known open problems

- **The city field is always null.** `CLUB_QUERY` in `tools/fetch_clubs.py`
  selects `?cityLabel` but never binds a `?city` variable anywhere in its
  `WHERE` clause — there is no `?club wdt:P159 ?city` or similar triple, so
  `SERVICE wikibase:label` has nothing to label and `?cityLabel` comes back
  unbound on every row. `city = cell(row, "cityLabel")` is therefore always
  `None`, and every club in `data/clubs/DE.json` and `data/clubs/RO.json`
  carries `"city": null`, confirmed by inspecting both files directly.
  `propose_coordinates.py`'s own `CITY_QUERY` binds `?city` correctly (via
  `?club wdt:P159 ?city` / `wdt:P131 ?city`), so the fix pattern already
  exists in this codebase — it was just never carried over to `CLUB_QUERY`.
  Not fixed here; recorded only.
- SV Meppen and 1. FC Schweinfurt are missing from the German layer
  entirely: neither comes back from the club query at all, and until the
  discovery query finishes there is no way to see which league Q-id they
  do carry. Erzgebirge Aue is a different case — it does come back, as
  `Q97927365`, and is dropped for the reason below.
- FC Unirea Dej has plainly wrong coordinates in Wikidata — placed near
  Bucharest, roughly 300km from Dej. FK Csíkszereda is the same kind of
  error, 31km from the nearest ground OpenStreetMap knows about.
- Wikidata carries two items for the same club more often than expected.
  Hamburger SV was the first, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig the second:
  `Q162317` with 39 Wikipedia sitelinks against `Q28936927` with 2, same
  league, ground, capacity and coordinates. Both duplicates now have a
  `skip` row in `clubs-manual.csv`. Nothing detects this automatically,
  so the next one will again show up as two pins on one ground.
- The cross-check has now been run for real. Of 185 clubs it compared,
  20 agree and 7 disagree; the rest could not be compared because only
  one source has a figure. Fortuna Düsseldorf (Wikidata 9,917 against
  OpenStreetMap 54,600) and 1. FC Saarbrücken (35,303 against 16,003)
  are the two worst. Preußen Münster was not among them — OpenStreetMap
  has no capacity for its ground, so nothing could be checked.
- Romanian capacities cannot be corroborated. OpenStreetMap has a usable
  capacity for exactly one Romanian ground out of the 404 it knows about,
  so the cross-check confirmed nothing there: 0 agreements, 0
  disagreements, 0 figures OpenStreetMap could supply on its own. Every
  Romanian capacity on the map is therefore either hand-entered or
  single-sourced from Wikidata, and no second source exists to catch a
  wrong one. Germany is only better by degree — 71 usable capacities out
  of 2,960 grounds.
- Both queries now exclude people with
  `FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?club wdt:P31 wd:Q5 }`. That worked for what it
  was aimed at: the German club count is unchanged apart from the
  duplicate removed on purpose, and the "in more than one mapped tier"
  figure fell from 4,104 to 3 for Germany and 1 for Romania. It did not
  fix the discovery query, so `unmapped-leagues.csv` still lists no
  German league at all. It has now been measured, though — see below.
- **The discovery query is slow because of the label service, not the
  join.** 20 timed probes, run 2026-09-16. Stripped of
  `SERVICE wikibase:label` the German query finishes in 8.9 seconds and
  returns 967 rows. Exactly the same query with the label service put
  back dies at the query service's 60-second ceiling, having streamed
  324KB of a half-written answer. The German answer was never large:
  967 rows, 138 different leagues. Romania's is 308 rows and 56 leagues
  and takes 5.8 seconds, labels and all — Germany sits just over a line
  Romania sits just under.
  - Paging is the wrong remedy. The whole German answer is one page of
    1,016 rows; `LIMIT 10000` returned all of it, and adding
    `ORDER BY` made it slower (27–30s against 4.6s), not faster.
  - Splitting by tier cannot be done: tier is what the discovery query
    exists to find out. Splitting by region needs `P131` on the club,
    which is exactly the data the missing clubs do not have.
  - Forcing the join order with `hint:optimizer "None"` made it worse:
    HTTP 504 after 65 seconds.
  - What did work, measured: asking which leagues have Germany as their
    country, counting clubs per league, instead of asking which clubs
    are in Germany and collecting their leagues. 6.9 seconds, 118
    leagues, labels included. The same shape returns Romania's 56 — the
    same 56 already in `unmapped-leagues.csv`, which is the evidence
    that it loses nothing.
  - Adding a "is a football club by type" filter is faster still (3.5s)
    but returns 74 leagues against 118. It drops 44, so it would undo
    the deliberate decision not to filter by type. Not worth it.
  - The trade-off in the turned-round version: it finds leagues *in*
    Germany rather than leagues *German clubs play in*, so a German club
    in a foreign league would no longer put that league in the seed
    list. Nothing about that has been decided — this is a measurement,
    not a change.
- **OpenStreetMap has now been asked where the unplaced clubs are**, by
  `propose_coordinates.py`, first real run 2026-09-16. Of the 31
  Regionalliga clubs with no coordinates: 9 got a confident proposal,
  19 are ambiguous, 3 got nothing. Five of the nine are certain enough
  to be worth reading first — the OpenStreetMap ground names the club in
  its `operator` tag (DJK Vilzing, SSV Jeddeloh, SV Rödinghausen,
  TSV 1896 Rain, VfB Auerbach). The other four rest on a town match and
  deserve a harder look. Six of the seven reserve teams are ambiguous on
  purpose: their town is the first team's town and says nothing about
  which of the club's grounds they play on. Nothing has been applied to
  any club file — `data/clubs/coordinate-review.csv` is a list to judge.
- Romania turns out to be the bigger hole, and it was never written
  down: 107 Romanian clubs have a tier and no coordinates, against 64 on
  the map. 31 confident, 32 ambiguous, 44 nothing. Most of the 44 are
  villages where OpenStreetMap has no named ground at all, which no
  amount of matching can fix.
- Romanian club names are full of words that are also village names —
  Unirea, Progresul, Viitorul, Cetate, Petrolul. The town match finds
  the wrong village and the club's town from Wikidata throws it out
  again, which is what that check is for. A club with no town in
  Wikidata has no such guard, so a row like that is worth more
  suspicion than its wording suggests.
- Four Romanian grounds are proposed for two clubs at once (Bacău,
  Vaslui, Darabani, Modelu). Sharing a municipal ground is normal, so
  the rows say so rather than being dropped — but "ACS Înainte Modelu"
  and "Înainte Modelu" are almost certainly one club with two Wikidata
  items, the same problem as Hamburger SV.
- **The club query pulls in things that are not clubs.** Five German
  items with a tier are Wikidata squad lists — "Kader der 2.
  Fußball-Bundesliga 2019/20", "Mannschaftskader der deutschen
  Fußball-Bundesliga" and so on. They carry `P118` exactly as a club
  does and are not people, so the `wdt:P31 wd:Q5` filter does not touch
  them. They only stay off the map because they have no coordinates: if
  one ever gained a `P625`, a squad list would appear as a pin. Nothing
  has been changed about this yet. `SC Veltheim` is a different oddity —
  a real club carrying a 3. Liga tag it should not have.
- The missing Regionalliga clubs are not a query problem, and the type
  filter was never what stood in the way. The club query returns 95 clubs
  tagged with one of the five mapped Regionalliga items. 31 of them have
  no ground (`P115`) and no coordinates (`P625`) anywhere on the item, so
  they are dropped at the coordinates gate; 64 survive, and 61 reach the
  map once two are moved to tier 3 by hand and one duplicate is skipped.
  The 31 are seven reserve teams (1. FC Köln II, FC Schalke 04 II,
  Hertha BSC II, Borussia Mönchengladbach II, FC Augsburg II,
  1. FC Nürnberg II, SpVgg Greuther Fürth II) and 24 first teams,
  including SV Rödinghausen, TSV Steinbach Haiger, FC Viktoria 1889
  Berlin, SV Heimstetten and FC Erzgebirge Aue. The gap is missing data
  in Wikidata, not a filter, so no change to the query will close it.
  What can close it is a second source, which is what
  `coordinate-review.csv` above now offers for 28 of the 31.
- Wikidata's Regionalliga season items carry no participant list
  (`P1923`) for any of the five divisions, so there is no way inside
  Wikidata to enumerate who should be in a division and compare it
  against what came back.
- Wikidata's `P3983` (league level) is not set on Bundesliga, so it
  cannot be the sole source of tier data. It can generate a draft of
  `league-tiers.csv` for review, which is the plan for expanding beyond
  Germany and Romania.
- OpenLigaDB is not yet wired up. It would cover 2. Bundesliga, 3. Liga,
  DFB-Pokal and Regionalliga. Bundesliga is deliberately excluded there,
  since football-data.org already covers it and two sources would mean
  reconciling two sets of ids.

## Planned, not built

1. A ticket-info file: official ticket page, whether a club sells to
   non-members, typical price range with the season noted, how demand
   behaves, whether matches sell out. **Stable facts only — sale dates
   and deadlines stay hand-written by Alexandru.**
2. Club detail sheet: a pull-up panel replacing the map popup, showing
   name, ground, capacity, competition name with tier in brackets,
   distance, fixtures and ticket info, each saying "unavailable" rather
   than being hidden when there is nothing.
3. Search box on the map, top right, live matches, enter flies to the club.
4. Badges. 284 crest URLs already sit unused in `data/fixtures/`.
   Wikidata `P154` covers German clubs patchily and Romanian ones barely.
   Licensing is unresolved: only freely licensed images may be used on a
   public site, and Wikipedia's non-free crests may not. Fallback is a
   generated marker — club colours plus initials.
5. Revamped bucket list and ticket info tabs, plus a fourth tab for
   memberships and tickets already held: cost, renewal date, benefits.
6. Expansion to more countries, one at a time.

Every change must actually land in the repository. Write files to disk, commit them, and push the branch — do not finish a task with changes left only in the working tree or described in the reply. When the task is done, state which files were committed and what the branch is called, so the diff can be reviewed.
